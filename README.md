# TagCloud jQuery plugin

A dynamic JavaScript tag/keyword cloud plugin for jQuery, designed to use with Ajax:
the cloud is generated from an array.

Usage:
------

Call it on a jQuery object created from one element and pass an array of
objects with "tag" and "count" attributes. E.g.:

var tags = [{tag: "computers", count: 56}, {tag: "mobile" , count :12}, ... ];
$("#tagcloud"}.tagCloud(tags);


Configuration:
--------------
Optionally you can pass a configuration object to tagCloud as the second
parameter. Allowed settings are:

sort: Comparator function used for sort the tags before displaying, or false if
   no sorting needed.

   default: sort by tag text using
          function (a, b) {return a.tag < b.tag ? -1 : (a.tag == b.tag ? 0 : 1)

click: Event handler which receives the tag name as first parameter
   and the original click event as second. The preventDefault() is called
   on event before passing so don't bother.

   default: does nothing:
          function(tag, event) {}


maxFontSizeEm: Size of the largest tag in the cloud in css 'em'. The smallest
   one's size is 1em so this value is the ratio of the smallest and largest
   sizes.

   default: 4


Styling:
--------
 The plugin adds the "tagcloudlink" class to the generated tag links. Note that
an "&nbsp;" is generated between the links too.
